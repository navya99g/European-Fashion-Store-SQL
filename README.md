  # European Fashion Store Data Analysis using SQL



## Project Overview


This project focuses on analysing a European fashion retail database to derive meaningful business insights related to sales performance, customer behaviour, product profitability, and campaign effectiveness, utilising SQL.

The analysis demonstrates the use of advanced SQL techniques such as joins, subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and recursive queries to solve real-world business problems.

## Dataset


The dataset consists of multiple relational tables:

- **Customers**: Customer demographic and signup details

- **Products**: Product, brand, category, and pricing information

- **Sales**: Sales transactions and channels

- **Salesitems**: Line-item level sales data including quantity, discounts, and revenue

All datasets are included in the repository for learning and portfolio purposes.
