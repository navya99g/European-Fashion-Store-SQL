\# SQL Concepts Used in This Project



This project demonstrates the practical application of advanced SQL concepts commonly used in data analytics and business intelligence roles.



---



\## 1. Joins

Used to combine data across multiple tables such as customers, products, sales, and sales items.

\- INNER JOIN

\- Multi-table joins



---



\## 2. Aggregations

Used to calculate metrics such as revenue, profit, discounts, and quantities.

\- SUM()

\- COUNT()

\- AVG()

\- GROUP BY

\- HAVING



---



\## 3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs were used to break down complex queries into readable and reusable components.

\- Simplified complex business logic

\- Improved query readability



---



\## 4. Window Functions

Used extensively for ranking, cumulative calculations, and trend analysis.

\- RANK()

\- LAG()

\- Moving Averages



---



\## 5. Recursive CTEs

Used to analyze month-over-month growth in customer purchase quantities.

\- Enables step-by-step hierarchical calculations

\- Useful for growth and retention analysis



---



\## 6. Conditional Logic

Used to segment customers and classify records.

\- CASE statements

\- Conditional aggregations



---



\## 7. Time-Based Analysis

Used for monthly trends and cohort analysis.

\- EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)

\- Time-series aggregations



---



\## 8. Percentile \& Distribution Analysis

Used to segment customers based on revenue contribution.

\- PERCENTILE\_CONT()



---



\## Summary

These SQL techniques collectively demonstrate the ability to handle real-world analytical requirements such as customer segmentation, revenue optimization, campaign evaluation, and growth analysis.
